# Blender and Molecular Dynamics Tutorial

This will be a _brief_ introduction to importing MD trajectories into the 3D animation software Blender, via Molecular Nodes.

Much more detailed tutorials and information are available on the [Molecular Nodes](https://bradyajohnston.github.io/MolecularNodes) website.

There are two components to this workshop. There will be a tutorial working through the basics of importing MD data into Blender, and also a quick showcase of running a jupyter notebook _on top of_ Blender, to enable ineteractive live viewing of a MDAnalysis notebook inside of Blender.

We will not included `.ipynb` will be demonstrated on the day, but installation can be complex and is likely to change in the coming months so participants will not be working through it themselves. The notebook does not use the same environment that was installed for the other jupyter notebooks used in this tutorial.

Outline for the workshop: 
- How to navigate the Blender interface
- Loading in an MD trajectory
- Changing using the node tree and changing the displayed style
- Doing an example render
- Finalising the styling
- Render and save an image
- Explanation and demo of rendering a video (render in own time)
- Explanation and example of interactive Blender + MDAnlaysis in Jupyter Notebooks
